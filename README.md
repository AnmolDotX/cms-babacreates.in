# Studio Babacreates

This project uses **Sanity** to manage the content for the portfolio. It serves as both the database and the content dashboard for the application.

## Integration

- **Frontend Repository**: [GITHUB_BABACREATES.IN](https://github.com/AnmolDotX/babacreates)

## Workflow

Changes to the schema or studio configuration can be updated directly from the local CLI. Run the following command to deploy changes:

```bash
npx sanity deploy
```

Although changes are deployed directly to Sanity, we maintain this repository on GitHub as a backup and for version control of the schema and configuration.
